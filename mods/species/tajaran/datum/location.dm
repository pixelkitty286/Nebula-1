	description = "Spacers, a loose group of Tajara who have emigrated from the homeworld, settling on alien worlds, stations, and ships.\
	 A majority of them have created tiny Tajaran communities, where one can sample authentic Tajaran cuisine, goods, religion, and medicine from the homeworld.\
	 A majority of the Tajara are refugees who depend deeply on their culture, as itâ€™s all they have left due to discrimination. Some Tajaran emigrants are pirates, smugglers, or part of organized crime families,\
	profiting off the decentralized powers of the galaxy. The newest waves of Tajaran emigrates are young, bold, and adventurous settlers usually who clash with the older immigrants who worked hard for their life offworld.\
	 Tajara under this banner are for individualism, freedom, and self-reliance."
